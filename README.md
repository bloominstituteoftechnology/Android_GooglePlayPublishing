# Android_GooglePlayPublishing

## Requirements
This is a simple one. Choose your favorite app you have worked on, create a store listing and publish the app on an internal test track. Add your PM email as well as the instructor email (these will be available through slack) Once the app has been published (it may take a couple hours for Google's servers to update) get the opt-in URL and add it to your README. The submit a pull request.

## App Test Opt In Link

Had a bug with gradle, currently working on updating to fix that, got all of the play store stuff set up, just need to build the apk and upload it. Will update readme as soon as that happens.
