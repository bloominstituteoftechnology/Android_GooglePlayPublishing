# Android_GooglePlayPublishing

## Requirements
This is a simple one. Choose your favorite app you have worked on, create a store listing and publish the app on an internal test track. Add your PM email as well as the instructor email (these will be available through slack) Once the app has been published (it may take a couple hours for Google's servers to update) get the opt-in URL and add it to your README. The submit a pull request.

## App Test Opt In Link

Waiting for the link once my app is approved.  Will update this to reflect that when that happens.
